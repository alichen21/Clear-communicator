# Product Definition Brief

## Product Name (Working Title)

**Speech Mirror / 表达镜子**

## 1. The Core Problem

I want my spoken expression to feel **substantial, structured, and easy to follow**.

However, in real conversations, my speech often becomes:

* scattered,
* jumpy,
* less clear than my actual thinking.

The core issue is **not lack of ideas**, but **lack of visibility**.

I cannot clearly *see* my own expression patterns:

* Where does my logic break?
* Where do I jump topics?
* Where do I stay abstract for too long?
* Where do I repeat instead of advancing?

Without visibility, improvement is blind and emotional. I need a system that reflects my expression back to me in a clear, structured, and compassionate way—so I can gradually build a more logical, grounded, and impactful speaking style.

## 2. The User & Usage Context

**The user is me** — a thoughtful person whose spoken expression does not always reflect the depth of their thinking.

Typical usage contexts include:

* Group discussions
* Work meetings
* Personal or emotional conversations
* Reflective self-talk or journaling
* Practicing explanations or public speaking

The user wants their speech to feel:

* **Substantive** (有内容)
* **Structurally clear** (有结构)
* **Easy to follow** (不费力)
* **Insightful** (有洞见)

The primary language is **Chinese**, with occasional **English words or phrases**.

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Core Experience

The simplest version that still feels *magical*:

1. The user records **up to 3 minutes** of speech with a single, simple action.
2. The audio is automatically transcribed.
3. The AI analyzes the transcription and provides:

   * a structured evaluation of the expression,
   * encouragement and praise based on what worked well,
   * a rewritten example showing a clearer version of the user’s intended message.
4. The user is invited to **record again on the same topic**, applying the feedback.

This creates a **reflection → practice → improvement** loop.

---

## 4. AI Evaluation Framework

The AI evaluates speech across **four universal dimensions**.

### Dimension 1: Logical Flow

**Focus:** Whether the sequence of ideas feels natural and continuous.

**Indicators:**

* Use of logical connectors (因为 / 所以 / 举个例子 / 总结来说)
* Smooth transitions between ideas
* No abrupt or unexplained topic shifts

---

### Dimension 2: Concrete & Specific

**Focus:** Whether abstract ideas are grounded in concrete reality.

**Indicators:**

* Abstract points followed by examples
* Emotional statements tied to specific events or moments
* Clear references to people, actions, or situations

---

### Dimension 3: Conciseness

**Focus:** Information density rather than length.

**Indicators:**

* Reduced repetition
* Fewer filler phrases
* Clear forward movement of ideas

---

### Dimension 4: Information Structure

**Focus:** Whether ideas are organized in an intuitive structure.

**Indicators:**

* Information grouped or categorized
* No more than three major points at once
* Recognizable structures (结论先行 / 因果 / 时间线 / 对比)

---

## 5. Feedback Output Design

Each analysis includes:

1. **Overall Impression**

   * What worked well
   * What felt clearer or more effective

2. **Dimension-by-Dimension Feedback**

   * Highlights (strengths)
   * No more than **two improvement points per dimension**

3. **Rewritten Example Expression**

   * A short, improved version of what the user *could* have said
   * Preserves the user’s intent and tone
   * Demonstrates clearer structure and specificity

---

## 6. Iterative Practice Loop

After receiving feedback, the system explicitly asks:

> “Would you like to record again on the same topic and try applying these points?”

For subsequent recordings:

* The AI compares the new attempt with previous ones
* Improvements are **explicitly acknowledged and praised**, such as:

  * clearer structure
  * more concrete examples
  * reduced repetition
* Feedback remains encouraging rather than corrective-only

---

## 7. History & Memory Design

### Stored Information

* Transcribed text of each recording
* AI analysis and feedback
* Highlighted improvement points

### Not Stored

* Raw audio files

### Interface Concept

A **ChatGPT-style split layout**:

**Left Panel**

* Topic and date
* Multiple attempts per topic (Attempt 1 / Attempt 2 / Attempt 3)
* Optional tags (e.g.「结构更清晰」「例子更具体」)

**Right Panel**

* Transcript
* AI analysis
* Rewritten example expression
* Improvement praise

This design allows the user to track progress over time and build confidence through visible growth.
